## Security

### Is Beans secure?

Security is our top priority.

We adhere to industry standards, ensuring that every part of our infrastructure and each stage
of our operations are built with security in mind. Beans uses HTTPS across all services,
including our public website. We routinely audit our security measures, including the
certificates we provide, the certificate authorities we rely on, and the ciphers we support.
