## Available Plans

Details about our plans, including volume discounts, are available on our
[pricing page](https://www.trybeans.com/pricing).

## Account Suspension

If an invoice remains unpaid 7 days after issuance or after two failed charge attempts,
your account will be marked as delinquent.

Once marked delinquent, the Beans app will become inactive on your website.

Please note that if payment is made after delinquency, account reactivation may take some time.

To prevent these issues, regularly verify that your payment information is up to date.

## Refund Policy

Beans provides flexible billing options with monthly and annual subscription plans.

### Annual Plan

A full refund is available for annual subscriptions canceled within 14 days of the initial
payment. After this period, refunds are not provided.

### Monthly Plan

For month-to-month plans, refunds are not available for cancellations at the start or during
the billing cycle.

## Supported Currencies

Currently, billing is supported only in USD. Expanding currency support is a priority, and
additional options will be added in the future.

If your currency differs from USD, billing will still be in USD, with the applicable
conversion rate set by your bank.
