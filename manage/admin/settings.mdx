## Account Suspension

If your invoice remains unpaid 7 days after its creation or after two failed charge attempts,
your account will be flagged as delinquent. When this happens, the Beans app will stop
functioning on your website.

Please note that even if you pay the invoice after your account is flagged, it may take some
time for your account to return to normal.

To avoid these issues, we recommend regularly checking that your payment details are up to
date.

## Refund Policy

Beans offers flexible billing options to suit your business needs, allowing you to choose
between monthly or annual subscription plans.

- **Yearly Plan**

Full refunds are available for annual subscriptions canceled within 14 days of the first
payment.
After this period, no refunds will be issued.

- **Monthly Plan**

For month-to-month plans, no refunds are provided if you cancel at the beginning or during
the middle of the billing cycle.

## Supported currencies

We currently only supported billing in USD. Internationalization is a big deal for us and we
are working to add support for more currency as soon as possible.

If your currency is not USD you will still be billed in USD. The default conversion rate
applied by your bank will be used to charge your account.

## Team Access

You can view and update your store details, edit your personal information, and manage access to your Beans workspace.
The plan and billing options also enable you to upgrade your plan and test your program before launching it.
