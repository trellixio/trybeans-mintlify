## Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is Beans for?**

Beans is designed for e-commerce. Whether you're an online merchant selling physical goods or
offering services, Beans can be a valuable tool to enhance your business.

**How do I start with Beans?**

To get started with Beans, check if there is an existing integration for your e-commerce
platform. This allows you to use Beans without handling the technical setup yourself. If
you prefer to work with the programming side, or if no integration is available, you or
your developer should explore our [API](https://api.trybeans.com/v3/doc/) for direct integration.
