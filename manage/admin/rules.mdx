## Why do rules have minimum points?

Why do some rules require to set a minimum points value?

Some rules in a rewards program require a minimum points value to ensure a balance between
customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Establishing appropriate point values is
critical to creating a rewarding experience for customers while maintaining the program's
financial viability.

Minimum points thresholds help prevent customer dissatisfaction caused by insignificant
rewards. For example, if a birthday reward is set to an excessively low value, such as 25
points (equivalent to $0.25), customers may feel undervalued. Receiving minimal rewards for
a year-long wait can lead to negative perceptions of the brand. Dissatisfied customers are
more likely to report reward notifications as spam, harming the brand's reputation and email
deliverability.

Email notifications play a key role in keeping customers engaged. However, frequent spam
reports from dissatisfied customers can affect the email deliverability of all merchants
using Beans, compromising the effectiveness of the platform.
Enforcing minimum points for certain rules promotes meaningful rewards encouraging
participation and ensuring a positive customer experience in your rewards program.
