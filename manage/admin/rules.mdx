Beans has a powerful rules engine designed to let you define how you want customers to earn points.
Using the rules, you can specify exactly how many points you want
to give to your customers when they complete a predefined action.
You can set as many rules as you like.
We recommend setting at least 5 or 6 rules to make your rewards program dynamic and attractive to your customers.
Rules are automated processes that ensure customers get rewarded as soon as actions are completed.

## Activate a rule

When you activate a rule, it becomes available to your customers. Customers will be able to see the rule
when they visit your rewards program page. There are three types of automated rules:
built-in rules, integration-dependent rules, and user-defined rules.

### Built-in rules

Built-in rules are readily accessible in the Beans admin interface and can be activated without any extra steps.
Some of these rules are even active by default.
For example, the [Register rule](/manage/rules/register) is a built-in rule that rewards
customers with an initial amount of points when they join your rewards program. This rule is active by default.

Adding a built-in rule is a straightforward process:

1. From the Beans admin interface, go to the **Rules** page.
2. From the top right, click on the **Add rule** button.
3. Locate the built-in rule that you want to add in the list of available rules and click on **Activate**.

### Integration-dependent rules

Some rules depend on setting up specific
[integrations between Beans and a third-party application](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations).
The integration is a requirement for the rule to function as expected.
For example, the [Judge.me integration](/integrations/judgeme)
lets you set up a rule to reward customers for product reviews.
Without setting up the Judge.me integration first, you will not be able to reward customers for reviews.

To add an integration-dependent rule, follow these steps:

1. From the [Integrations directory](/manage/admin/integrations),
   locate the integration that you are interested in and install it.
2. From the Beans admin interface, go to the **Rules** page.
3. From the top right, click on the **Add rule** button.
4. Locate the integration-dependent rule that you want to add in the list of available rules and click on **Activate**.

### User-defined rules

Beans allows merchants to define custom rules.
It is the merchant's responsibility to ensure that the rule is correctly implemented and functions as expected.
User-defined rules are super flexible and let you virtually reward customers for almost anything you can imagine.
To implement custom rules, you need to use the [Beans API](https://api.trybeans.com/v3/doc).

## Set up a rule

Once you have activated a rule, you can configure its parameters.
When applicable, you can edit how many points to award to customers for completing the action.
Additionally, some rules let you configure extra parameters such as conditions that customers should meet
to be rewarded or limits on how often the customer can be rewarded for the action.

To set up a rule's parameters, follow these steps:

1. From the Beans admin interface, go to the **Rules** page.
2. Locate the rule that you want to edit in the list of activated rules and click on **Edit**.
3. Update the rule settings and click on **Save**.
4. You might want to wait an hour for the updates to propagate to all servers,
   especially for rules that depend on third-party integrations.
5. Test the rule to ensure that the update is effective.

## Deactivate a rule

If a rule no longer suits your objectives, you can deactivate it:

1. From the Beans admin interface, go to the **Rules** page.
2. Locate the rule that you want to deactivate in the list of activated rules and click on **Edit**.
3. At the bottom left, click the **Deactivate rule** button.
4. You might want to wait an hour for the updates to propagate to all servers,
   especially for rules that depend on third-party integrations.
