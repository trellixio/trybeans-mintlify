## Metrics

In addition to insights on the usage of the rules, the analytics page helps track key metrics such as:

- **New members enrolled**: This metric shows the number of new customers who
  have enrolled in your rewards program over a specified
  period. It helps you understand the growth and reach of your program, allowing you to assess the
  effectiveness of your marketing and engagement efforts.

- **Number of daily redemptions**: Track how frequently customers are redeeming
  their points on a daily basis. This metric provides insights
  into customer engagement and the attractiveness of your redemption options. High redemption rates can
  indicate strong customer interest and satisfaction with the rewards offered.

- **Loyalty revenue**: Loyalty revenue includes orders where customers have used points for redemptions.
  This metric helps you quantify the financial contribution of your rewards program to overall sales.
  Analyzing loyalty revenue can assist in evaluating the return on investment (ROI) of your loyalty initiatives.

- **Referral revenue**: This metric tracks the revenue generated from customer referrals. It includes
  sales made by new customers who were referred to your business through your rewards program. Analyzing
  referral revenue helps you assess the effectiveness of your referral program, understand its impact on
  customer acquisition, and calculate the return on investment for referral incentives.

- **Referral Orders Count**: This metric displays the total number of orders placed by referred customers.
  It helps you gauge the effectiveness of your referral program in driving actual purchases, allowing you
  to assess the conversion rate of referred customers into paying customers.

- **Referred Customers Count**: This metric shows the number of new customers who have joined your
  platform through referrals. It provides insight into how well your referral program is attracting new
  customers, helping you evaluate its success in expanding your customer base.

- **Invitation Sent Count**: This metric tracks the number of referral invitations sent by your existing
  customers. It helps you understand how actively your customers are participating in the referral
  program and can indicate the program's popularity among your customer base.
