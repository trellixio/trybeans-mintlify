The Beans tier system is a powerful tool that allows merchants to create different levels of membership
within their rewards program. Each tier can offer unique benefits and incentives, encouraging customers to
engage more with your brand and strive to reach higher tiers.

Tiers are levels within your rewards program that customers can achieve based on their activity and
engagement. Each tier offers distinct benefits, creating a sense of exclusivity and motivating customers to
increase their participation. Merchants can tailor rewards and benefits to each tier, making the program more
attractive and personalized.

The Beans tier system allows merchants to define up to three tiers. Each tier can have a points multiplier,
meaning customers in higher tiers earn more points per purchase than those in lower tiers. This incentivizes
customers to reach higher tiers for better rewards.

### Points multiplier

Merchants can set a points multiplier for each tier. For example, customers in the lowest tier may earn 5 points per dollar spent, while those in the highest tier earn 10 points per dollar spent. This encourages customers to make more purchases to move up the tiers and earn points faster.

### Tier-specific benefits

Merchants can also define tier-specific benefits to enhance the attractiveness of each tier. Examples of
tier-specific benefits include:

- **Exclusive access to collections**: Restrict access to certain product collections to higher-tier members.
- **Free shipping**: Offer free shipping to customers in specific tiers.
- **Special discounts**: Provide additional discounts or offers to higher-tier members.
- **Early access to sales**: Allow higher-tier members to access sales or new products before others.

### Setting up tiers

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Tiers** page.
2. Define the number of tiers you want to create (up to 3 tiers).
3. Set the points multiplier for each tier.
4. Define the specific benefits for each tier.
5. Save your settings to activate the tiers.
