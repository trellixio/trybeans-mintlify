Beans prioritizes data protection and maintains full compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We've built our platform with privacy at its core to protect both your business and your customers' data.

## How we protect your data

**Customer data management**

Beans provides tools to help you fulfill customer data rights requests. You can easily export customer data and permanently delete it when requested. We automatically expire visitor data after 9 months of inactivity to minimize data storage and maintain GDPR compliance.


**Security measures**

We encrypt all data at rest and in transit. Our team performs regular security audits and maintains strict access controls.


**Data Processing Agreement**

Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) clearly outlines our commitment to data protection. This agreement details how we process data, our security measures, and both parties' responsibilities under GDPR.


**International data transfers**

Beans is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework for compliant international data transfers.


**Vendor management**

We ensure all vendors meet our data protection standards and maintain Data Processing Agreements with them.
