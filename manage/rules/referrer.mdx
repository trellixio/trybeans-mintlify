<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 300 and 1000 points per review.</Tip>

The referral rule helps you incentivize customers who recommend
your business to their families and friends by rewarding them.
Customers get rewarded when they refer a friend to your store that completes a purchase.
Referrals are considered successful only when the referred customer is a new customer placing their first order.

## How it works

Each customer who joins your referral program gets access to a unique referral link.
The referral link helps track new customers that are being referred to your store.
From the referral page, the customer can email the referral link to their friends or share it directly on social media.
The customer can copy the link and share it with their friends through any other channel.

After registering for an account on the shop, the referred customer
will get their [referral invite reward](/manage/rules/invitation) if it was set.

A referral is deemed successful when the referred customer makes a purchase using the invite link or code.
When the referral is successful, the referrer gets their reward.
The referrer will only get rewarded for the first order placed by their friend.

## Settings

- **Minimum purchase**: This setting allows you to set a minimum amount for the referral order.
  The referral gets rewarded only if the referral order exceeds the minimum purchase limit.

## Fraud prevention

The referral program is designed with security measures to prevent fraud and ensure that
referrals are genuine. These measures help protect merchants from potential abuse and maintain the integrity
of the referral program.

- **Reward only after purchase completion**: The referrer only receives their reward once the referred
  customer completes a purchase. This ensures that rewards are given for legitimate transactions.

- **Minimum purchase amount**: Merchants can set a minimum purchase amount that the referred customer must
  meet before the referrer is rewarded. This protects merchants from losing money on small, non-profitable
  referrals and ensures that the referral program contributes to meaningful sales.

- **No self-referrals**: The system is designed to prevent customers from referring themselves. Beans
  automatically detects and blocks any attempt to use the same account or information to generate a referral
  for oneself.

- **No referrals to existing customers**: A customer cannot refer someone who is already an existing
  customer.

- **IP and delivery address monitoring**: Beans monitors IP addresses and delivery addresses to detect and
  raise warnings on suspicious referral activity. If multiple referrals are coming from the same IP address
  or delivery address, the system flags these as potentially fraudulent and alerts the merchant to review
  these referrals.
