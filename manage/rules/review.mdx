<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 100 and 300 points per review.</Tip>

The product review rule is a great way to encourage customers to share their feedback
and experiences with your products. This rule not only helps improve your product
visibility but also fosters a community of engaged customers.
The product review rule rewards customers with points for writing reviews of your products.
By incentivizing reviews, you can gather valuable customer feedback,
enhance your product's credibility, and attract more potential buyers.

## How it works

When a customer writes and submits a product review through your integrated review system,
they are automatically awarded the specified number of points.
This encourages more customers to share their opinions and enhances the overall customer experience.

For example, consider the following scenario:

A customer purchases a product from your store and, after using it,
decides to write a review. Upon submitting the review through
your integrated review system, they receive 30 points as a reward.
