<Tip>The recommended period for this rule is 50-70 days.</Tip>

The Inactivity Rule is a key component of our loyalty program, designed to boost customer engagement by imposing a penalty for inactivity.
This rule causes customers to lose a predetermined number of points after a specified period of non-engagement, encouraging more frequent interactions with your store.

## How it works

After a certain number of days without any activity in your store, customers will lose a set number of points. The inactivity period is
calculated from the last time they earned or redeemed points.

#### Example

- On January 1st, 2024: A customer earns 100 points.
- On March 11th, 2024: After 70 days without any points-related activity, 50 points are deducted due to inactivity, leaving the customer with 50 points.
- On March 12th, 2024: The customer earns an additional 200 points, bringing their total to 250 points.

## Settings

-**Points**: This setting allows you to set the number of points a customer will lose after the inactivity period.

-**Inactivity Period(in days)**: This setting determines the number of days a customer's points can remain unused before deductions apply.
