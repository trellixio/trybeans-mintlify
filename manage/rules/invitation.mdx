<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 300 and 1000 points.</Tip>

The referral invite rule helps you implement a two-sided referral system.
It gives the referred friend an incentive to encourage them to place their first order using the referral link or code.
Providing a reward to the referee lowers the barrier to entry, making them more likely to try the product or service.

## How it works

When a customer registers for a shop account using the referral link,
they get the invite reward in addition to any [registration reward](/manage/rules/register) if it was set.
