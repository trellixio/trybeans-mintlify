<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 200 and 500 points awarded yearly on the birthday.</Tip>

The birthday rule is designed to reward customers on their special day,
encouraging loyalty and showing appreciation for their continued patronage.
By offering points on their birthday, you create a positive connection and enhance customer satisfaction.

Customers receive points on their birthday as a special reward.
To be eligible, customers must set their birth date at least 48 hours before their birthday.
This prevents fraud and ensures that the system has awarded the points accurately.

## How it works

On January 15th, a customer sets their birth date as July 20th.
On July 20th, they will receive 300 points as a birthday reward.
This special gift not only makes them feel valued but also encourages
them to make a purchase to use their birthday points.
It is important to note that the customer does not receive any reward on January 15th.
