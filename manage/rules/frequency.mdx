</Tip>

The repeat purchase rule is designed to encourage customers to make a second purchase within
a specified time frame by offering bonus points. This rule is an excellent way to increase repeat
business and reward customers for their continued loyalty. The repeat purchase rule can be customized
to fit your business goals, allowing you to define the percentage of bonus points awarded and the interval period.

## How it works

When a customer makes a second purchase within the specified interval period,
they receive a percentage of bonus points based on the value of their purchase, in addition to
the points they have received according to the [Loyalty rule](/manage/rules/loyalty).

For example, consider the following order details:

- Loyalty rule value: 10 points/$
- Cart booster rule bonus: 50%
- Repeat purchase rule interval: 90 days
- First purchase subtotal: $50
- Second purchase subtotal: $70

In this scenario, if the customer makes a second purchase of $70 within 90 days of their first purchase of $50,
they will qualify for the repeat purchase rule bonus.
The customer will get 700 points for their loyalty according to the value set for the loyalty rule.
In addition, the customer will receive 50% of the points they earned through the loyalty rule, thus 350 points.
In total, the customer will be awarded 700 points + 350 points = 1,050 points for the second purchase.

```math
Bonus pointsÂ earned = 50% * 10 points/$ * $70 = 350 points
```
