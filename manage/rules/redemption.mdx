<Info>
  The redemption rule is one of the cornerstone rules of the rewards program and is active by default for all rewards
  programs.
</Info>

<Warning>The value of this rule cannot be edited.</Warning>

The redemption rule defines how customers can use their points.
Points have a dollar value (or equivalent currency unit).
Points can be redeemed by shoppers during checkout to get a discount on their purchase.
The redemption rule, also referred to as the redemption rate,
is the conversion rate used to compute the value of the points accumulated by customers.
It is set to 100 points are worth $1 (or equivalent currency unit).

## How it works

Customers have the option to use their points during the checkout process.
When a customer decides to redeem their points, the maximum amount of
redeemable points for the order is withdrawn from their Beans account and applied to the order.
Customers do not decide on the quantity of points they want to redeem.
The discount does not apply to shipping fees.

For example, consider the following order:

- Subtotal (Cart value): $100
- Shipping Fees: $20
- Total: $120

The shopper has a balance of 3,500 points. When they choose to redeem,
they will get a discount of \$35 = 3,500 points / 100 points/\$.
This discount will decrease the subtotal value of the cart by $35.

```math
Discount = Points balance / 100
```

## Settings

The redemption can be configured to maximize your business goals.
It is possible to set a maximum discount by redemption as a percentage of the cart value,
to force customers to reach a minimum balance before being able to redeem,
or limit redemption to a collection of items.
The redemption options differ by integration and can be configured at the integration level.

## Redemption rate

The default redemption rate is the best rate to, psychologically,
maximize customers' engagement in your rewards program.
It is easier for shoppers to compute the points value when 100 points are worth \$1, than
when 250 points are worth \$1. It also offers the best granularity to configure your rewards program.

For example, a redemption rate of 10 points to \$1
makes it impossible to give customers less than 10% cashback value on orders.
With such a rate, the minimum number of points you could award to a customer per dollar
spent is 1 point which would be 10 cents.
Conversely, a redemption rate of 1,000 points to \$1 creates unnecessary inflation that decreases the value of the points.
If you need to collect a thousand units of something before just getting a dollar discount, it does not sound enticing.

While the redemption rate is fixed, it is worth noting that all the other rules' values are customizable.
This implies that you still have 100% control over the value of your rewards program.
You still decide the value of the reward awarded to customers.
In addition, the redemption settings allow
you to set how customers can use their points.

## Redeem points

How can customers redeem their points in the store?

By default, customers can redeem their points on the cart page. If you are using WooCommerce or Shopify Plus, you also have the option to allow customers to redeem their points directly on the checkout page.

## How to Redeem Points:

1. **Log In**: Ensure you are logged into the shop with the email address associated with your rewards program notifications. If you don’t have an account linked to that email, please create one. The system will automatically connect it to your rewards program account using your email.

2. **Add Items to Cart**: Select a product and add it to your cart.

3. **Access the Cart**: Go to the cart page, where you will find the option to redeem your points near the checkout button
   (make sure you are logged in).

4. **Redeem Points**: Click the redeem button. Based on the redemption conditions set by the retailer (detailed on the
   rewards program page), a discount will automatically be applied to your cart.

<Warning>
  You cannot manually select the number of points to redeem; the system will automatically choose the maximum number of
  points you can use for that particular purchase.
</Warning>

## Redemption Issues

If a customer cannot see the option to redeem their points after logging into their shop account, it may mean that the Beans app is not correctly installed in the store.

If the customer fails to complete their order after redeeming points, or if their order does not go through due to a declined
payment, their points will be [refunded after a specific delay.](https://docs.trybeans.com/manage/rules/redemption#pending-debits)

## Pending debits

A pending debit transaction occurs when the customer attempts to redeem their points.
At the moment a shopper attempts to redeem their points during a purchase, a debit is created with the status pending.
This means that the debit is not yet fully recorded into the customer's account history.
Once the customer completes the order, the debit status is
updated from pending to committed and the transaction will be recorded in the history.

The pending state exists to prevent customers from exploiting the system.
For example, a customer could try to redeem multiple orders
at the same time and get more discounts than they are allocated.
It also allows customers to cancel the redemption process at any time without any drawback.

The pending debits can be monitored by the merchant in the Beans admin dashboard when looking at a
member's transactions history.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why is the default redemption rate 100 points to $1?

The default redemption rate of 100 points to $1 makes it easier for
both merchants and shoppers to know the value of points.
For example, if you give the customer 5 points for each dollar spent, this would be equivalent to 5% cashback.
So it makes it easier to resonate in terms of percentage.
It is worth noting that in the Beans system, points can only be whole numbers, so you cannot give a decimal amount of points.
So the default rate gives you the best granularity. 1 point is worth ¢1 (one cent).

#### Is it possible to update the redemption rate to 1 point worth $1?

This is a frequent question that we get from merchants.
This is in fact a very bad idea.
Since in the Beans system points can only have integer values,
this would mean that if you are giving your customers 1 point per dollar spent,
they will get 100% cashback. Better list your products for free.

#### What if my local currency is inflated and has a lot of digits?

In some currencies, product prices are already in the thousands.
And the default rate of 100 points to 1 unit of currency makes
it possible for the customer to have a large digit amount of points, for example, millions or billions of points.
While this is not a technical limitation, it can disturb the customer experience and cause display overflow in some places.
The Beans team is aware of this issue and is working on solutions.

#### Will there be any way in the future to adjust the redemption rate?

At this stage, our team is exploring solutions to make Beans even more accessible to more merchants,
especially those who are working with an "inflated currency".
There is a feature request on our [roadmap](https://beans.productlane.io/roadmap) about it.
