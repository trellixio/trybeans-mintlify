<Warning>This rule requires the activation of the [Loyalty rule](/manage/rules/loyalty).</Warning>

<Tip>
  The recommended value for this rule is between 50% and 100% bonus points for orders over 2x your average order value.
</Tip>

The cart booster rule is designed to encourage higher spending by offering
bonus points for purchases that exceed a specified amount.
This rule is a great way to increase your average order value and reward customers for larger purchases.
The cart booster rule can be customized to fit your business goals,
allowing you to define the percentage of bonus points awarded and the spending threshold.

## How it works

When a customer's order total exceeds the specified amount, they receive a percentage of bonus points
based on the value of their purchase in addition to
the points they have received according the [Loyalty rule](/manage/rules/loyalty).

For example, consider the following order details:

- Loyalty rule value: 10 points/$
- Cart booster rule bonus: 50%
- Cart booster threshold amount: $100
- Subtotal (Cart value): $130
- Discount (Coupon code): $20
- Shipping Fees: $0
- Taxes: $0
- Total: $110

In this scenario, the order qualifies for the cart booster rule bonus
since its total of \$110 exceeds the threshold of \$100.
The customer will get 1,100 points for their loyalty according to the value set for the loyalty rule.
In addition, the customer will receive 50% of the points they earned through the loyalty rule, thus 550 points.
In total, the customer will be awarded 1,100 points + 550 points = 1,650 points.

```math
Bonus points earned = 50% * 10 points/$ * $110 = 550 points
```
