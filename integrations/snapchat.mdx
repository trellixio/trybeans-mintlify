[Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/) is a multimedia platform that connects people
and brands through instant, creative content and stories.
[Integrating Beans with Snapchat](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:snapchat)
allows merchants to significantly increase their brand engagement by offering an attractive
incentive such as rewarding customers for following the brandâ€™s account on Snapchat. This
innovative collaboration helps merchants leverage visual engagement to build stronger
customer loyalty and enhance their online presence.

## Setup

1. From the Beans admin, go to **Integrations**.
2. Locate **Snapchat** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click on the **Connect** button and proceed as directed.
4. Grant Beans permission to access your Snapchat account.

## Rules

### Points for Snapchat Follow

This feature allows you to reward customers with loyalty points when they follow your Snapchat
page, enhancing engagement and growing your social media presence.

**How it works:** Once you enable this feature and
[activate the rule](https://docs.trybeans.com/manage/admin/rules#integration-dependent-rules),
customers can earn points by following your brand on Snapchat. This applies to both new and existing
followers, ensuring all your customers have the opportunity to be rewarded.

**Important details:** Customers are rewarded with points only once for following
the page. The system ensures that points are not awarded multiple times to the same
customer, even if they unfollow and refollow the page. If a customer decides to unfollow
your brand, the points previously awarded for following will not be revoked.

## Status

This interface provides control over the status and data synchronization between Beans
and Snapchat, offering options to disconnect the integration, or reset the connection as
needed.

To access the status page:

1. Navigate to the Snapchat integration home page
2. Click on **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
