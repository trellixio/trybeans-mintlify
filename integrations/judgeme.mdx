### Points for product reviews with photos

Reward your customers more generously when they include photos with their product reviews.
This rule take precedence over the classic points for text-only reviews.
This is irrespective of which rule offers a higher point reward.
Consequently, it's advisable to assign a higher point value to reviews with photos
compared to text-only reviews, ensuring a more attractive incentive for customers
to share visually enriched feedback.

## Reviews log

The reviews log offers merchants a straightforward and efficient way to track the history of all rewarded reviews.
Within this log, merchants can quickly ascertain whether a shopper has been awarded points for their review and the
exact amount of points credited. Additionally, if a shopper has not received points for their review, the log
provides a detailed explanation, clarifying the reason behind the omission. This functionality ensures transparency
and ease in managing the rewards process for product reviews.
