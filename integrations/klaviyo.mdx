## Metrics

A metric indicates a specific type of event that occurred within the Beans app
and was subsequently synced to your Klaviyo account.
The following events are synced to your Klaviyo account.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Beans member created">
    This event is triggered when a customer joins the loyalty program.
    Use this metric to set up a welcome email to customers who join the rewards program.
    The welcome email is the perfect opportunity to get shoppers excited about the loyalty program.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_0e65355mlysieu"
    Beans Member Points: "300"
    Beans Member Points Value: "3"
    Beans Tier: "Basic"
    $value: "300"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans points credited">
    This event is triggered when a customer earns points.
    Use this metric to send customers an email notification when they earn points.
    Customers appreciate instant gratification. Sending notifications promptly upon point accrual
    reinforces their positive behavior and encourages repeat purchases.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "32730"
    Beans Member Points Value: "327.3"

    Beans Transaction Sign: "+"
    Beans Transaction Type: "credit"
    Beans Transaction Description: "Extra bonus for purchasing twice or more in the last 120 days"
    $value: "32730"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans points debited">
    This event is triggered when a customer spends or loses points.
    Informing customers when points are debited provides transparency about how their points are used or deducted.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "21990"
    Beans Member Points Value: "219.9"

    Beans Transaction Sign: "-"
    Beans Transaction Type: "debit"
    Beans Transaction Description: "Debited for a $238 discount - redeemxvzwlymi"
    $value: "21990"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans tier downgraded">
  Â This event is triggered when a customer is moved to a lower tier in the loyalty program.
  This event, while potentially sensitive, presents an opportunity to engage with customers
  effectively and provide a clear explanation of why the tier downgrade occurred.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "13580"
    Beans Member Points Value: "135.8"
    Beans Tier: "Gold"
    Beans Tier Old: "Diamond"
    $value: "13580"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans tier upgraded">
    This event is triggered when a customer is promoted to a higher tier
    in the loyalty program. Use this event to clearly communicate the benefits and advantages
    that come with the newly attained tier.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "13580"
    Beans Member Points Value: "135.8"
    Beans Tier: "Diamond"
    Beans Tier Old: "Gold"
    $value: "13580"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans points reminder">
    This event is sent periodically to remind customers about their unused points.
    It serves as a gentle reminder to customers that they have accumulated points
    that can be redeemed for rewards.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_0000000000"
    Beans Member Points: "500"
    Beans Member Points Value: "5"
    Beans Tier: "Diamond"
    $value: "500"
    ```
