#Metrics

A metric indicates a specific type of event that occurred within the Beans app and was subsequently synced to your Klaviyo account.
The following events are synced to your Klaviyo account:

- **Beans member created**: This event is triggered when a customer joins the loyalty program. Use this metric to set up a welcome email
  to customers who join the rewards program. The welcome email is the perfect opportunity to get shoppers excited about the loyalty
  program.
- **Beans member credited**: This event is triggered when a customer earns points. Use this metric to send customers an email notification
  when they earn points. Customers appreciate instant gratification. Sending notifications promptly upon point accrual reinforces their
  positive behavior and encourages repeat purchases.
