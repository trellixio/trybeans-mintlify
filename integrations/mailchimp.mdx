MailChimp is an email marketing platform that supports creating effective email campaigns to
engage audiences. [Integrating Beans with MailChimp](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:mailchimp)
enables merchants to embed loyalty rewards in email communications, increasing customer
engagement and encouraging repeat purchases through targeted, reward-focused emails.

## Setup

You can integrate Mailchimp with our application in the Integration section of the Beans admin
interface.

1. From the Beans admin, go to **Integrations**.
2. Locate **MailChimp** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click on the **Connect** button and proceed as directed.
4. Log in to your existing account, If you don't have an account, sign up for MailChimp.
5. Grant Beans permission to interact with your Mailchimp account.

## How it works

Once connected, you can import your list of members from Beans into Mailchimp, with automatic
synchronization to keep the list up to date.

## Requirements

On the Mailchimp free plan, only one list is allowed, which is created by default upon
account setup. To import your members from Beans, ensure this list capacity has not been
reached. Full integration functionality requires a Mailchimp paid plan.

## Status

This interface provides control over the status and data synchronization between Beans
and MailChimp, offering options to disconnect the integration, or reset the connection
as needed.

To access the status page:

1. Navigate to the MailChimp integration home page
2. Click on **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
