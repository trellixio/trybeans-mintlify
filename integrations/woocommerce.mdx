WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-woocommerce-loyalty-rewards/)
from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.

To manually connect Beans to your WooCommerce store, follow these steps:

## Referencing WooCommerce Pages

Adding a Program Link to Your Storeâ€™s Navigation Menu.

WordPress provides a drag-and-drop menu interface that allows you to easily configure the navigation menu for your website.

Your website can feature multiple menus, such as:

- The **Main menu** at the top, which gives customers quick access to important pages like collections.
- The **Footer menu** at the bottom, providing links to additional pages like "About Us."
  For easier access, we recommend adding the link to your loyalty program in the Main menu, making it convenient for customers
  to find and engage with the program.

Here is a guide:

## Rewards page

The Beans plugin for WooCommerce automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `http://myshop.com/rewards-program`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://myshop.com`.

To display the rewards program page, Beans uses the shortcode `[beans_page]`.
This makes it very easy to edit the page if necessary.

It is recommended to add the link to your rewards program in the main menu to make it easy for your customers to access.

## Caching

Many WordPress websites use caching to improve performance for visitors.
While caching can enhance website speed and traffic, it can be difficult to debug, especially for dynamic websites.

In most cases, it is recommended **not** to cache dynamic pages because cached versions
may become outdated or inaccurate. There are two types of pages on a website: static and dynamic.
A static page has unchanging content, whereas dynamic pages frequently update and are not suitable for caching.

We recommend excluding the rewards program page and the referral program page from your caching system
because they are dynamic and do not display the same content for each customer.

### WP Rocket

Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure exclusions with WP Rocket:

1. Navigate to the **File Optimization** section in WP Rocket.
2. Uncheck all checkboxes in the **JavaScript Files** section and save your changes.
3. Go to the **Advanced Rules** option and add the following lines to the **Never Cache URLs** section:

   ```txt
   /rewards-program/(.)
   /referral-program/(.)
   /my-account/(.*)
   ```

4. Save your settings.
5. Clear your cache and visit the program pages in your store.
