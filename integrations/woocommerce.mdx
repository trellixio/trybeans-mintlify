WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the WooCommerce integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Updating Your Shop Domain

To ensure secure service, Beans verifies that the data received from your shop is authentic, helping prevent data tampering.
Beans checks that the domain sending the data matches the one set by the retailer when creating their account.

If you update your WordPress site or WooCommerce shop domain, Beans will not automatically recognize the change and will reject data
from the updated domain.

To fix this, after updating the domain, simply [Reinstall](https://docs.trybeans.com/integrations/woocommerce#reinstall) the Beans integration to ensure a smooth connection between
your store and the app.

Afterward, on the Beans admin dashboard, go to the [Settings](https://app.trybeans.com/settings/general) page and update your website link. Be sure to save.
Once these steps are complete, Beans will accept data from your shop, and the app should function as expected.
