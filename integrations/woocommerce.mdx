WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-woocommerce-loyalty-rewards/)
from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.

To manually connect Beans to your WooCommerce store, follow these steps:

2. Find **Beans** and select **settings**.
3. On the Beans admin page within WordPress, follow the prompts and click **Connect**.
4. Select your Beans account or create a new one. If you already have one, log in.
5. Once on the connect page, choose **Connect manually**.
6. Provide WooCommerce API keys as instructed.
7. In WordPress admin, go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API**.

Beans provides a straightforward solution to address this without any negative side effects.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the WooCommerce integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Edit Beans Pages

Adding Information to the Rewards Program Page

The Beans plugin for WooCommerce automatically creates a rewards page for your shop, typically accessible
at `http://myshop.com/rewards-program` (based on your website's full URL).

The page is powered by the Beans shortcode `[beans_page] `, allowing you to easily add additional content without removing the shortcode.

To edit the page and add information:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, go to **Pages > All Pages** in the left-hand menu.
2. Find the **Reward Page** and click **Edit**.
3. In the text editor, insert your additional content, ensuring you keep the shortcode `[beans_page]` intact.
4. Click Update to save your changes.

If your rewards page is not in the menu, take the opportunity to add a link to it, so that customers can easily access it.
