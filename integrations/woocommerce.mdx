WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively. Integrating Beans
with WooCommerce enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.
