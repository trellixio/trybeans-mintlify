WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)

you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.
