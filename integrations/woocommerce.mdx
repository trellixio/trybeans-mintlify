## Account Synchronization

Customers with existing accounts on your store are automatically synchronized with the rewards
or referral program within 24 hours of the application's installation.

## Updating Your Shop Domain

To ensure secure operations, Beans validates data by verifying that it originates from the
domain registered in your Beans account. This process protects against data tampering and
unauthorized access.

If the domain of your WordPress site or WooCommerce shop changes, Beans will not automatically
recognize the new domain. As a result, data from the updated domain will be rejected. To
address this, you must update the domain linked to your Beans account by reconnecting the
integration on the WooCommerce integrations page.

## Reconnect integraton

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the WooCommerce integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Disconnect Integration** Beans.
4. Once disconnected, you can [Set Up](https://docs.trybeans.com/integrations/woocommerce#setup)
   your WooCommerce integration again.

After completing these steps, Beans will recognize the new domain and resume processing data
from your shop. If issues persist, contact the Beans support team for assistance.
