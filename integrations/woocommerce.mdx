WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-woocommerce-loyalty-rewards/)
from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.

To manually connect Beans to your WooCommerce store, follow these steps:

## Connection Issues

How to Fix Connection Problems When Connecting Your Store to Beans

The Beans plugin uses the WooCommerce API to deliver services that help you sell more. However, when connecting our
application to your store, we perform checks to ensure all required configurations are functioning properly.

## Case HTTP Status: 200, 401

If you receive a 401 HTTP status and your website is password-protected, or if you're using a “coming soon” or “site
under construction” plugin that restricts public access, this will also block API access, which is essential for our
application. To resolve this:

Temporarily disable the plugin to allow connection, then reactivate it afterward.
For example, if your store link is [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com), follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://www.example.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/](https://www.example.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/) and verify that you see a page similar to the image below.

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/images/integrations/woocommerce/error-1.webp" alt="Reinstall" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

2. Go to [https://www.example.com/wp-json/wc/v2/](https://www.example.com/wp-json/wc/v2/) and confirm the page looks like the example provided.

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/images/integrations/woocommerce/wp-json.webp" alt="Reinstall" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

3. Now, use the following link to connect:
   [https://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=beans-woo&force_beans=1](https://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=beans-woo&force_beans=1)
   Replace [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com) with your actual domain name and follow the normal process.

## Case HTTP Status: 0

If you encounter a status 0 during configuration checks, it indicates an issue occurred while attempting to connect to your store. This usually happens when your SSL certificate is invalid. Renew your SSL certificate and try again.

## Case HTTP Status: 404

For more details on resolving a 404 error, refer to the following article:
Connecting Beans Application to WooCommerce Stores

Other Cases
Here are some additional common issues and solutions:

- **Outdated WooCommerce Version**: If your store is using WooCommerce version 3.9 or older, update to the latest version
  before installing the Beans plugin.
- **Incorrect WordPress Installation Location**: WordPress must be installed at the domain or subdomain level, not at the
  page level. For example, if you're developing a store at `www.example.com/dev/`, our server will attempt to connect
  to `www.example.com`. To avoid this issue, install the development store on a subdomain like the `dev.example.com`
- **Caching Plugin Issues**: If you have a caching plugin that strips the "Authorization" header, try disabling plugins one
  by one to identify the culprit.

If you’ve tried all of the above and the issue persists, it may be due to your server stripping the "Authorization"
header. As this relates to web server configuration and third-party WordPress plugins, Beans cannot provide support for
this issue. However, you can try the following:

<Warning>
  Since this issue relates to the configuration of your web server and other WordPress plugins, Beans cannot provide
  support in these cases. You can try the suggestions below, but please consult a web developer before making any
  configuration changes.
</Warning>

Add the following line to your `.htaccess` file:

`SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1`

If this does not resolve the issue, review your caching plugin's settings to ensure headers are not being cached or
stripped.

If you are still experiencing issues, please contact your hosting provider for further assistance.
## Edit Beans Pages

Adding Information to the Rewards Program Page

The Beans plugin for WooCommerce automatically creates a rewards page for your shop, typically accessible
at `http://myshop.com/rewards-program` (based on your website's full URL).

The page is powered by the Beans shortcode `[beans_page] `, allowing you to easily add additional content without removing the shortcode.

To edit the page and add i+nformation:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, go to **Pages > All Pages** in the left-hand menu.
2. Find the **Reward Page** and click **Edit**.
3. In the text editor, insert your additional content, ensuring you keep the shortcode `[beans_page]` intact.
4. Click Update to save your changes.

## Setting Up Permalinks

In some cases, you may encounter difficulties connecting our plugin to your store, often due to issues with your
**permalinks configuration**.

If you are seeing a 404 status error, it means the application is unable to locate certain URLs in your shop. To resolve
this issue:

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and click on **Permalinks**.
3. Under the **Common Settings** section, select **Post name**.
4. Scroll down and click the **Save Changes** button.

    src="/assets/images/integrations/woocommerce/permalinks.gif"
    alt="Reinstall"
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />
</Frame>

If your rewards page is not in the menu, take the opportunity to add a link to it, so that customers can easily access it.
If the issue persists, please [contact](https://www.trybeans.com/contact) our support team.

## Referencing WooCommerce Pages

Adding a Program Link to Your Store’s Navigation Menu.

WordPress provides a drag-and-drop menu interface that allows you to easily configure the navigation menu for your website.

Your website can feature multiple menus, such as:

- The **Main menu** at the top, which gives customers quick access to important pages like collections.
- The **Footer menu** at the bottom, providing links to additional pages like "About Us."
  For easier access, we recommend adding the link to your loyalty program in the Main menu, making it convenient for customers
  to find and engage with the program.

Here is a guide:

https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-navigation-menu-in-wordpress-beginners-guide/

## Rewards page

The Beans plugin for WooCommerce automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `http://myshop.com/rewards-program`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://myshop.com`.

To display the rewards program page, Beans uses the shortcode `[beans_page]`.
This makes it very easy to edit the page if necessary.

It is recommended to add the link to your rewards program in the main menu to make it easy for your customers to access.
Here is how to do it: [How to Add Navigation Menu in WordPress](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-navigation-menu-in-wordpress-beginners-guide/)

## Caching

Many WordPress websites use caching to improve performance for visitors.
While caching can enhance website speed and traffic, it can be difficult to debug, especially for dynamic websites.

In most cases, it is recommended **not** to cache dynamic pages because cached versions
may become outdated or inaccurate. There are two types of pages on a website: static and dynamic.
A static page has unchanging content, whereas dynamic pages frequently update and are not suitable for caching.

We recommend excluding the rewards program page and the referral program page from your caching system
because they are dynamic and do not display the same content for each customer.

### WP Rocket

Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure exclusions with WP Rocket:

1. Navigate to the **File Optimization** section in WP Rocket.
2. Uncheck all checkboxes in the **JavaScript Files** section and save your changes.
3. Go to the **Advanced Rules** option and add the following lines to the **Never Cache URLs** section:

   ```txt
   /rewards-program/(.)
   /referral-program/(.)
   /my-account/(.*)
   ```

4. Save your settings.
5. Clear your cache and visit the program pages in your store.
