## Redemption

### Minimum Points Requirement for Redemption

The minimum points requirement establishes a threshold that customers must meet in their
accounts to qualify for point redemption. This threshold ensures that points are sufficiently
accumulated before redemption, promoting meaningful engagement with the rewards program.

**Example**

If the minimum points required for redemption is set to 100, customers will need at least 100
points in their account to redeem rewards.

### Maximum Discount per Redemption

The maximum discount per redemption defines the upper limit of the purchase price that can be
offset using points. This parameter ensures that point-based discounts remain within predefined boundaries.

**Examples**

If a customer is purchasing a product worth `$10` and has 1000 points (equivalent to `$10`)
and the maximum discount is set to 50%, they will be able to redeem
only 500 points, resulting in a `$5` discount.

### Subscription Redemption

In order to allow customers to offset the cost of their subscription renewals, the subscription
redemption feature enables them to apply earned points directly to their payments. This
functionality helps to enhance the perceived value of your reward program.

### Role Exclusion

The Role Exclusion feature allows you to define specific WordPress user roles that should be
excluded from earning rewards in the program. Any user assigned to these roles will not
accumulate rewards for their purchases.

When specifying roles in this field, it is important to note that it is case-sensitive. Ensure
you enter the role names exactly as they appear in your WordPress settings to avoid any
discrepancies.

### Eligible Collections

Use this option to specify collections eligible for points redemption. By selecting specific
collections, you can restrict redemptions to those collections only.

If no collections are selected, redemption will be allowed on all collections by default.

### Display

**Redemption on Checkout**

Enable this option to show the redemption button on the checkout page, allowing customers to
redeem points directly during their purchase.

**Product Points**

Activate this setting to display points information on individual product pages, helping
customers understand how many points they can earn or redeem for specific products.

**Cart Notices**

Show customers their points balance with a notification on the cart page by enabling this
option. This keeps them informed about their rewards during checkout.

**Beans Watermark**

Disable this option to remove the "Powered by Beans" watermark from the footer of the rewards
program page, ensuring a more branded appearance for your store.

**Auto Registration**

Turn this setting on to automatically enroll new customers in the rewards program, simplifying
the registration process and encouraging engagement.
