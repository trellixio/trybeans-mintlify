WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-woocommerce-loyalty-rewards/)
from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.

## Referencing WooCommerce Pages

Adding a Program Link to Your Storeâ€™s Navigation Menu.

WordPress provides a drag-and-drop menu interface that allows you to easily configure the navigation menu for your website.

Your website can feature multiple menus, such as:

- The **Main menu** at the top, which gives customers quick access to important pages like collections.
- The **Footer menu** at the bottom, providing links to additional pages like "About Us."
  For easier access, we recommend adding the link to your loyalty program in the Main menu, making it convenient for customers
  to find and engage with the program.
