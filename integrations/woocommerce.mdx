WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants
with the tools they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with WooCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:woocommerce)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants
to boost customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for WooCommerce,
you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-woocommerce-loyalty-rewards/)
from the WordPress plugin repository. Follow the
[WordPress guideline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/) for plugin installation.
After installation, activate the plugin and connect Beans to your shop using the setup instructions.

## Connection Issues

How to Fix Connection Problems When Connecting Your Store to Beans

The Beans plugin uses the WooCommerce API to deliver services that help you sell more. However, when connecting our
application to your store, we perform checks to ensure all required configurations are functioning properly.

## Case HTTP Status: 200, 401

If you receive a 401 HTTP status and your website is password-protected, or if you're using a “coming soon” or “site
under construction” plugin that restricts public access, this will also block API access, which is essential for our
application. To resolve this:

Temporarily disable the plugin to allow connection, then reactivate it afterward.
For example, if your store link is [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com), follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://www.example.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/](https://www.example.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/) and verify that you see a page similar to the image below.

<Frame>

</Frame>

2. Go to [https://www.example.com/wp-json/wc/v2/](https://www.example.com/wp-json/wc/v2/) and confirm the page looks like the example provided.

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/images/integrations/woocommerce/wp-json.webp" alt="Reinstall" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

3. Now, use the following link to connect:
   [https://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=beans-woo&force_beans=1](https://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=beans-woo&force_beans=1)
   Replace [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com) with your actual domain name and follow the normal process.

## Case HTTP Status: 0

If you encounter a status 0 during configuration checks, it indicates an issue occurred while attempting to connect to your store. This usually happens when your SSL certificate is invalid. Renew your SSL certificate and try again.

## Case HTTP Status: 404

For more details on resolving a 404 error, refer to the following article:
Connecting Beans Application to WooCommerce Stores

Other Cases
Here are some additional common issues and solutions:

- **Outdated WooCommerce Version**: If your store is using WooCommerce version 3.9 or older, update to the latest version
  before installing the Beans plugin.
- **Incorrect WordPress Installation Location**: WordPress must be installed at the domain or subdomain level, not at the
  page level. For example, if you're developing a store at `www.example.com/dev/`, our server will attempt to connect
  to `www.example.com`. To avoid this issue, install the development store on a subdomain like the `dev.example.com`
- **Caching Plugin Issues**: If you have a caching plugin that strips the "Authorization" header, try disabling plugins one
  by one to identify the culprit.

If you’ve tried all of the above and the issue persists, it may be due to your server stripping the "Authorization"
header. As this relates to web server configuration and third-party WordPress plugins, Beans cannot provide support for
this issue. However, you can try the following:

<Warning>
  Since this issue relates to the configuration of your web server and other WordPress plugins, Beans cannot provide
  support in these cases. You can try the suggestions below, but please consult a web developer before making any
  configuration changes.
</Warning>

Add the following line to your `.htaccess` file:

`SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1`

If this does not resolve the issue, review your caching plugin's settings to ensure headers are not being cached or
stripped.

If you are still experiencing issues, please contact your hosting provider for further assistance.
