## Replacement tags

Replacement tags are dynamic placeholders used in email templates to personalize content for each recipient. When an email is sent, these tags are automatically replaced with actual customer data such as names, points balances, and transaction details.

### Global tags

Global tags work across all email notifications and help personalize your communications:

- `[%first_name%]` - Inserts the customer's first name
- `[%unsubscribe_link%]` - Inserts an unsubscribe link that allows customers to opt out of emails

### Notification-specific tags

Each email notification type has its own set of unique tags for personalizing content. These specialized tags allow you to include relevant details. You can find the available tags for each notification type in the Notifications section above.
