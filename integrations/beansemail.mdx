## Important note

Beans Emails is designed specifically for loyalty program notifications. While it effectively
handles automated loyalty program communications, it is not intended to be a comprehensive
email marketing solution.

For advanced email marketing features and fine tuned notifications, we recommend using
dedicated [email marketing platforms that we integrate with](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations#marketing).

## Replacement tags

Replacement tags are dynamic placeholders used in email templates to personalize content for each recipient.
When an email is sent, these tags are automatically replaced with actual customer data such as names, points balances,
and transaction details.

Global tags work across all email notifications and help personalize your communications:

- `[%first_name%]` - Inserts the customer's first name.
- `[%last_name%]` - Inserts the customer's last name.
- `[%unsubscribe_link%]` - Inserts an unsubscribe link that allows customer's to opt out of emails.

- `[%beans_balance%]`- Inserts the customer's balance in points.
- `[%tier_name%]` Inserts the customer's tier name.
  <Tip>This [%tier_name%] tag will only display data if the tier feature is activated.</Tip>

### Notification-specific tags

Each email notification type has its own set of unique tags for personalizing content.
These specialized tags allow you to include relevant details. You can find the available tags
for each notification type in the Notifications section above.
