[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com) is a fast-growing platform that connects
people and brands through short, engaging video content. The
[integration between Beans and TikTok](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:tiktok) allows
merchants to significantly increase brand engagement by offering a compelling incentive:
rewarding customers for following the brandâ€™s TikTok account. This strategic collaboration helps merchants
leverage social interactions to build customer loyalty and enhance their online presence.

## Setup

1. From the Beans admin, go to **Integrations**.
2. Locate **Tiktok** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click on the **Connect** button and proceed as directed.
4. Grant Beans permission to access your Tiktok account.

## Rules

### Points for Tiktok Follow

This feature allows you to reward customers with loyalty points when they follow your
Tiktok page, enhancing engagement and growing your social media presence.

**How it works:** Once you enable this feature and
[activate the rule](https://docs.trybeans.com/manage/admin/rules#integration-dependent-rules), customers can
earn points by following your brand on Tiktok. This applies to both new and existing
followers, ensuring all your customers have the opportunity to be rewarded.

**Important details:** Customers are rewarded with points only once for following the
page. The system ensures that points are not awarded multiple times to the same customer,
even if they unfollow and refollow the page. If a customer decides to unfollow your brand,
the points previously awarded for following will not be revoked.

## Status

This interface provides control over the status and data synchronization between Beans
and Tiktok, offering options to disconnect the integration, or reset the connection as
needed.

To access the status page:

1. Navigate to the Tiktok integration home page
2. Click on **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
