Beans provides an comprehensible and user-friendly API to help integrate seamlessly with your custom online store.

## Storefront Integration

The storefront integration allows you to embed Beans into your online store. This script displays relevant information
to your customers, such as the loyalty program page, and tracks customer interactions, like referral tracking.

## Webhooks Integration

Webhooks enable Beans to receive notifications when specific events occur in your store, such as when a customer places
an order. These webhooks allow Beans to execute event-driven actions, like rewarding customers after a purchase.
