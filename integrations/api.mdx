Beans provides an comprehensible and user-friendly API to help integrate seamlessly with your custom online store.

## Storefront Integration

The storefront integration allows you to embed Beans into your online store. This script displays relevant information
to your customers, such as the loyalty program page, and tracks customer interactions, like referral tracking.

## Webhooks Integration

Webhooks enable Beans to receive notifications when specific events occur in your store, such as when a customer places
an order. These webhooks allow Beans to execute event-driven actions, like rewarding customers after a purchase.

## Webhooks

Setting up Beans Webhooks for your online shop

Incoming webhooks allow Beans to receive notifications about new events in your store, such as when a customer completes an order, enabling them to be rewarded for their loyalty.
These are simple URLs to which you send a JSON payload containing the message and related options.

### Customer Webhook

The Customer Webhook notifies Beans when a new customer registers in your shop. To send new customer information to
Beans, use an HTTP POST request like this example:

#### Customer data

```
{
    "id": 1847,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "is_newsletter": True,
    "tags": ["loyal", "paying"],
    "created_at": "2020-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
    "updated_at": "2022-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
}
```

#### Create or update a customer

```
curl https://hooks.radix.trybeans.com/v3/hook/radix/vanilla/customer/hook_created \
  --request POST \
  --user :sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '<<customer_data>>'
```

#### Delete a customer

```
curl https://hooks.radix.trybeans.com/v3/hook/radix/vanilla/customer/hook_deleted \
  --request POST \
  --user :sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '<<customer_data>>'
```

#### Order Webhook

The Order Webhook informs Beans when a new order is placed in your shop. To send new order information to Beans,
simply use an HTTP POST request, similar to this example:

Order data
An order can contain a customer object.

```
order_data = {
    "id": 13207,
    "currency": "USD",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "ref": "13207",
    "total": "53.00",
    "subtotal": "33.00",
    "amount_shipping": "20.00",
    "amount_giftcard": "0.00",
    "amount_tax": "0.00",
    "cancelled_at": None,
    "processed_at": "2022-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
    "is_fulfilled": False,
    "is_refunded": True,
    "is_paid": True,
    "customer": {
        "id": 1847,
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "is_newsletter": True,
        "tags": ["loyal", "paying"],
        "created_at": "2020-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
        "updated_at": "2022-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
    }
}
```

#### Create or update an order

```
curl https://hooks.radix.trybeans.com/v3/hook/radix/vanilla/order/hook_created \
  --request POST \
  --user :sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '<<order_data>>'
