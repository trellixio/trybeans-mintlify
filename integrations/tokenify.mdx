Tokenify is a powerful Beans integration that streamlines API authentication, empowering merchants to access their data
effortlessly via the Beans API. This innovative solution generates unique API authentication credentials, perfect for
merchants seeking to:

1. Create customized tasks tailored to their specific needs.
2. Leverage their Beans data for personalized insights and automation.

<Warning>
  The API keys provided by Tokenify are exclusively designed for individual merchants, enabling them to access their
  data. They are not intended for partners developing integrations for multiple merchants. This ensures each merchant's
  secure and personalized experience, safeguarding their sensitive data.
</Warning>

Merchants receive a unique set of API tokens, comprising a public identifier and a secret
token, to secure access to their data.

## How it Works

Tokenify provides a secure authentication system through API tokens. When you enable Tokenify, you'll receive:

1. A Merchant Account Identifier - Your unique account reference
2. A Public ID - Used to identify your account in API requests
3. A Secret Token - Your private key for secure authentication

These tokens work together to authenticate and authorize your API requests, ensuring only your authorized applications can access your merchant data.
