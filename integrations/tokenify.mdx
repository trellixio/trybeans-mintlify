Tokenify is a powerful Beans integration that streamlines API authentication, empowering merchants to access their data
effortlessly via the Beans API. This innovative solution aids in identifying merchants and their brands. By [integrating Beans with Tokenify](https://www.bns.re/integrations/trellis:tokenify), merchants can generate unique API authentication credentials, making it ideal for those looking to:

1. Create customized tasks tailored to their specific needs.

2. Leverage their Beans data for personalized insights and automation.

<Warning>
  The API keys provided by Tokenify are exclusively designed for individual merchants, enabling them to access their
  data. They are not intended for partners developing integrations for multiple merchants. This ensures each merchant's
  secure and personalized experience, safeguarding sensitive data.
</Warning>

Merchants receive a unique set of API tokens, comprising a public identifier and a secret token, to secure access to their data.

## How it Works

These tokens authenticate and authorize API requests, ensuring only authorized applications can access merchant data.
The tokens are generated by merchants and consist of:

1. A public identifier (Merchant Public ID)

2. A secret token (Merchant Secret Token)
