Beans API Tokens is a utility that lets merchants generate and manage API authentication credentials.
It's designed to help merchants:

- Integrate Beans with their existing tech stack
- Create custom business logic with Beans data
- Access Beans data through the Beans API for analytics and automation

<Warning>
  The API tokens provided by this integration are designed for individual merchants use, enabling them to access their
  data. They are not intended for partners developing integrations for multiple merchants.
</Warning>

## How it works

Once activated Merchants receive a unique set of API tokens, comprising a public identifier and a secret token.
Public identifier can be used to access non-sensitive data from the storefront
or any other place where security is not a concern. Secret token should be used server-side for accessing Beans API
endpoints that require authentication. To learn more about how to use the API, please refer to the
[API documentation](https://api.trybeans.com/v3/doc).

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the API to access Beans data.
