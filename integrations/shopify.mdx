## Shopify POS

Does Beans support Shopify POS?

While Beans does not yet fully support Shopify POS, integration is in the development
pipeline. Currently, the following features are supported:

**Automatic Enrollmen**t: When a customer provides their email address during a purchase and
agrees to receive marketing emails, they are automatically enrolled in your rewards program.

**Points Allocation**: Customers who provide their email address and either agree to receive
marketing emails or are existing rewards program members will automatically earn points
for their purchases, provided you have configured a loyalty rule.

The following features are not supported:

**Redemption on POS**: Points redemption is not yet integrated with Shopify POS. However,
you can manually adjust points in the Beans interface to debit customers for redemptions.

If your order volume permits, you may choose to use Beans alongside Shopify POS, understanding
that the redemption process must be handled manually. Please report any issues or bugs you
encounter while using this setup.
