Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that provides
merchants with the tools they need to sell products online efficiently.
[Integrating Beans with Shopify](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:shopify)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants to boost
customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/beans)
through the Shopify App Store. Follow the
[Shopify guideline](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps#install-through-the-shopify-app-store)
on how to install an app through the Shopify App Store.

## Customer accounts

In order to get the app to work as expected, it is required to enable customer accounts for your Shopify Store.
Shopify gives you the option to set customer accounts as disabled, optional or required.
Beans requires customer accounts to be set to optional or required.
Beans support both _Classic customer accounts_ and _New customer accounts_.

Here is how to enable customer accounts with Shopify:

## Shopify OS 2.0

If you are using a Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme, it is essential to enable the Beans app in your Shopify theme.
The new Online Store 2.0 is an improvement released by Shopify to facilitate
full integration for app developers with a merchant's shop.

1. From the Shopify dashboard, go to your Themes page.
2. Locate the Current theme section and click on Customize.
3. Click on Theme Settings, go to the App Embed tab, then locate the Beans Ultimate app extension and switch it on.

## Rewards page

Beans automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `https://example.myshopify.com/pages/rewards`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://example.myshopify.com`.

The Shopify navigation tool let you dynamically set up a navigation menu for your website.
We recommend adding the link to the rewards program in the Main menu in order to make it easy for your customers to access.

## Redemption

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/images/integrations/shopify/redemption.webp" alt="Redemption" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

### Minimum points required for redemption

Sets a minimum points threshold that customers must reach before redeeming rewards. By default,
customers need to accumulate at least 100 points before being eligible for redemption. You can
adjust this threshold higher to ensure meaningful program engagement and prevent inefficient redemptions.
For example, if you set the minimum to 500 points, customers would need to earn at least 500 points before
they can start redeeming rewards.

**How it works:**

1. From the Shopify integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Redemption** section and enter your desired minimum points threshold in the
   **Minimum Points Required** field.
3. Click **Save** to apply changes.

<Tip>
  Choose a minimum threshold that balances customer satisfaction with your business goals. Too high may discourage
  participation, while too low could reduce program effectiveness.
</Tip>

### Maximum discount per redemption

Sets a limit on how much of the total purchase price can be discounted through points.
This ensures that the discounts provided through redemptions remain within acceptable
limits for your business. For example, if a customer wants to buy a product priced at \$10 and
has 1000 points (equal to \$10), but the maximum discount is set to 50%, they can only use 500
points, giving them a \$5 discount.

**How it works:**

1. From the Shopify integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Redemption** section and use the **Maximum Discount Per Redemption** slider to set
   your desired maximum discount percentage.
3. Click **Save** to apply changes.

<Tip>
  Setting a reasonable maximum discount percentage helps maintain a balance between rewarding customers and protecting
  your profit margins.
</Tip>

## Using discount codes with points redemption

When customers redeem points, Beans generates a discount code that automatically applies to their
cart at checkout. The ability to combine this with other discount codes depends on your Shopify plan:

**Shopify (Classic)**

- Only one discount code can be used per checkout.
- Points redemption discount codes cannot be combined with other discounts.

**Shopify Plus**

- Multiple discount codes can be enabled at checkout.
- Some discount codes may still be incompatible due to conflicting rules.
- Review your discount settings to ensure smooth points redemption.

## Shopify customer tags

When you enable [tiers](https://docs.trybeans.com/manage/admin/tiers) in Beans, the system
automatically adds tier-specific tags to your customers in Shopify. These tags make it easy
to identify customer tier levels, create segments, track progression, and target marketing
campaigns based on loyalty tiers directly in Shopify.

  <img
    src="/assets/images/integrations/shopify/customer-tag.webp"
    alt="Reset synchronization"
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />
</Frame>

For example, if a customer reaches the Gold tier, they'll receive the tag **Beans-Tier-Gold** in their Shopify profile.

<Tip>
  Tier tagging is automatically enabled as soon as you activate tiers in Beans and connect your Shopify store - no
  additional setup required.
</Tip>
