## Redemption

**Minimum Points Requirement for Redemption**

The minimum points requirement specifies the threshold of points a customer must accumulate in
their account to be eligible for redemption. This parameter ensures sufficient point
accumulation before redemption.

**Maximum Discount per Redemption**

The maximum discount per redemption limits the amount of the total purchase price that can be
discounted through points. This ensures that the discounts provided through redemptions remain
within acceptable limits for your business.
