## Shopify POS

### Does Beans support Shopify POS?

Currently, Beans does not fully support Shopify POS, but it is on our development roadmap.

Here's what is currently supported:

**Automatic enrollment in the rewards program**:

If a customer completes a purchase, provides their email address, and agrees to receive marketing
emails, they are automatically enrolled in your rewards program.

**Order credit allocation**:

Customers are automatically credited for their purchase when they either provide their email
address and agree to receive marketing emails or are already members of your rewards program,
provided you have set up a loyalty rule.

Features not yet supported:

**Redemption on POS**:
Customers cannot redeem rewards directly through Shopify POS. However, you can manually debit
their points using the Beans interface.

While the redemption process is not integrated, you may still use Beans with your Shopify POS
depending on your order volume. If you encounter any issues while using the system, please inform us so we can address them.

We are committed to improving Beans to better meet your needs and integrate seamlessly with
Shopify POS in the future.
