Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that provides
merchants with the tools they need to sell products online efficiently.
[Integrating Beans with Shopify](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:shopify)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants to boost
customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/beans)
through the Shopify App Store. Follow the
[Shopify guideline](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps#install-through-the-shopify-app-store)
on how to install an app through the Shopify App Store.

## Reinstall

If you suspect the Beans plugin isn't properly installed on your Shopify site,
Beans provides a straightforward solution to address this without any negative side effects.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the Shopify integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Shopify POS

Currently, Beans does not fully support Shopify POS, but it is on our roadmap. Here is what is already available:

- When a customer completes a purchase, provides their email address, and consents to receive marketing emails, they are
  automatically enrolled in your rewards program.
- When a customer is a member of your rewards program or agrees to receive marketing emails during a purchase, they will
  be credited for the order (assuming a loyalty rule has been set up).

#### Features not supported

Redemption on POS is not yet supported, but you can manually debit points from customers' accounts through the Beans interface.
Depending on your order volume, you may still want to use Beans with Shopify POS, keeping in mind that the redemption process is not integrated. If you choose to do so, please report any bugs or issues you encounter.
