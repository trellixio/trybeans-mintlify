If you are using a Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme, it is essential to enable the Beans app in your Shopify theme.
The new Online Store 2.0 is an improvement released by Shopify to facilitate
full integration for app developers with a merchant's shop.

1. From the Shopify dashboard, go to your Themes page.
2. Locate the Current theme section and click on Customize.
3. Click on Theme Settings, go to the App Embed tab, then locate the Beans Ultimate app extension and switch it on.

## Rewards page

Beans automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `https://example.myshopify.com/pages/rewards`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://example.myshopify.com`.

The Shopify navigation tool let you dynamically set up a navigation menu for your website.
We recommend adding the link to the rewards program in the Main menu in order to make it easy for your customers to access.

## Customer accounts

In order to get the app to work as expected, it is required to enable customer accounts for your Shopify Store.
Shopify gives you the option to set customer accounts as disabled, optional or required.
Beans requires customer accounts to be set to optional or required.
Beans support both _Classic customer accounts_ and _New customer accounts_.

## Using discount codes with points redemption

Managing potential conflicts between discount codes and points redemption in your Beans rewards program.

Beans applies points redemption by generating discount codes, which are automatically applied
to your customer’s cart at checkout. The compatibility of these codes with other discounts
depends on your Shopify plan and settings.

**Shopify (Classic)**

If you are using the classic version of Shopify, customers cannot apply multiple discount
codes at checkout. This means that when a customer redeems points through Beans, they won’t
be able to use another discount code simultaneously.

**Shopify Plus**

If you are a Shopify Plus merchant, you can enable multiple discount codes at checkout
by contacting Shopify to activate the feature for your store. However, even with this
capability, discount codes might still be mutually exclusive. This happens when one
discount code’s rules conflict with another, such as:

- Cart-specific discount limitations.
- Custom redemption rules, including minimum points redemption.

It’s important to review your discount and redemption settings to ensure your customers can
redeem their points without issues while maintaining proper management of other discount codes.
