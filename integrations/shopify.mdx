customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Using Discount Codes with Points Redemption on Shopify

This article explains how Shopify merchants can handle conflicts between discount codes and points redemption through the Beans
rewards program.

## How it Works:

Beans rewards program applies points redemptions using discount codes. When a customer redeems their points, a discount
code is automatically generated and applied to their cart.

#### Shopify (Classic)

If you are using the classic version of Shopify (not using Shopify Plus), customers are restricted to using only one discount
code at checkout. This means if a customer wishes to redeem their points, they cannot simultaneously apply another discount code.

#### Shopify Plus

Shopify Plus merchants have the option to allow multiple discount codes at checkout. However, enabling this feature
requires contacting Shopify to activate it specifically for your store. Merchants considering this should be aware of the potential
complexities:

- **Mutually Exclusive Discounts**: Even when multiple discounts are technically allowed, certain codes might not be compatible with one another. For
  example, one code might offer a percentage off the total cart value, which could conflict with a fixed amount off provided by the
  points redemption.

- **Custom Redemption Rules**: If you have set specific conditions for using points, such as minimum cart values or certain items being
  exempt from discounts, these rules might conflict with other active discount codes.
