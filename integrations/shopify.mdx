## Shopify customer tags

Tagging Shopify Customers with VIP Tier Levels

The [Tiers](https://docs.trybeans.com/manage/admin/tiers) feature enables you to offer tiered
memberships, allowing customers to access different loyalty benefits based on their level.
A customer's tier status is automatically updated when they meet specific conditions, enabling
promotion to a higher tier or demotion to a lower one.

Beans automatically tags customers in Shopify with their current tier level. This
tagging allows you to easily identify a customerâ€™s tier directly in Shopify and
segment them based on their loyalty level.
For instance, when a customer is promoted to the Gold tier, the tag **Beans-Tier-Gold** is
added to their profile in the Shopify dashboard.

<Tip>
  This feature is automatically enabled when the tier functionality is activated and your Shopify store is connected.{' '}
