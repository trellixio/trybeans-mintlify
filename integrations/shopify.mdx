## Redemption

**Minimum points requirement for redemption**

The minimum points requirement specifies the threshold of points a customer must accumulate in
their account to be eligible for redemption. This parameter ensures sufficient point
accumulation before redemption.

**Maximum discount per redemption**

The maximum discount per redemption limits the amount of the total purchase price that can be
discounted through points. This ensures that the discounts provided through redemptions remain
within acceptable limits for your business.

## Rewards page

Beans automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `https://example.myshopify.com/pages/rewards`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://example.myshopify.com`.

The Shopify navigation tool let you dynamically set up a navigation menu for your website.
We recommend adding the link to the rewards program in the Main menu in order to make it easy for your customers to access.

## Customer accounts

In order to get the app to work as expected, it is required to enable customer accounts for your Shopify Store.
Shopify gives you the option to set customer accounts as disabled, optional or required.
Beans requires customer accounts to be set to optional or required.
Beans support both _Classic customer accounts_ and _New customer accounts_.
