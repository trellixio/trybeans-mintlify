Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that provides
merchants with the tools they need to sell products online efficiently.
[Integrating Beans with Shopify](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:shopify)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants to boost
customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/beans)
through the Shopify App Store. Follow the
[Shopify guideline](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps#install-through-the-shopify-app-store)
on how to install an app through the Shopify App Store.

## Reinstall

If you suspect the Beans plugin isn't properly installed on your Shopify site,
Beans provides a straightforward solution to address this without any negative side effects.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the Shopify integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Shopify Customer Tags

Tagging Customers with VIP Tier Levels

<Tip>This feature is activated by default when you enable the tier feature and have connected your Shopify store.</Tip>

The Tiers feature allows you to create membership levels where customers can enjoy different loyalty benefits based on their tier.
As members meet the conditions for each tier, their status is automatically updated, promoting or demoting them as appropriate.

Beans automatically tags customers in Shopify with their current tier level. This makes it easy to see which tier a customer belongs
to directly within the Shopify dashboard. It also simplifies customer segmentation by tier. For example, when a customer joins the
Gold tier, a tag like Beans-Tier-Gold will be added to their profile in Shopify.
