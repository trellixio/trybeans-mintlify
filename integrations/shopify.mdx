## Using discount codes with points redemption

Managing potential conflicts between discount codes and points redemption in your Beans rewards program.

Beans applies points redemption by generating discount codes, which are automatically applied
to your customer’s cart at checkout. The compatibility of these codes with other discounts
depends on your Shopify plan and settings.

**Shopify (Classic)**

If you are using the classic version of Shopify, customers cannot apply multiple discount
codes at checkout. This means that when a customer redeems points through Beans, they won’t
be able to use another discount code simultaneously.

**Shopify Plus**

If you are a Shopify Plus merchant, you can enable multiple discount codes at checkout
by contacting Shopify to activate the feature for your store. However, even with this
capability, discount codes might still be mutually exclusive. This happens when one
discount code’s rules conflict with another, such as:

- Cart-specific discount limitations.
- Custom redemption rules, including minimum points redemption.

It’s important to review your discount and redemption settings to ensure your customers can
redeem their points without issues while maintaining proper management of other discount codes.
