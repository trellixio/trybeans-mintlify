<Note>
  This guide will help you integrate Beans with Shopify to create a powerful loyalty rewards system for your store. 
</Note>

Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that provides
merchants with the tools they need to sell products online efficiently.
[Integrating Beans with Shopify](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:shopify)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants to boost
customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

1. Install the [Beans app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/beans) through the Shopify App Store
2. Follow the [Shopify installation guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps#install-through-the-shopify-app-store)
3. Once installed, you'll be guided through a simple configuration process to set up your rewards program

## Reinstall

If you suspect the Beans plugin isn't properly installed on your Shopify site,
Beans provides a straightforward solution to address this without any negative side effects.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the Shopify integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Shopify Limitations

### Shopify API rate

Shopify uses three different methods for managing rate limits. Different APIs use different methods depending on the use
case.

The various types of rate limits your apps will encounter are:

- **Request-based limits**: Apps can make a maximum number of requests per minute.

For example, 40 API requests within 60 seconds. Each request counts equally, regardless of how much or how little data is returned. This method is used by the REST Admin API.

- **Time-based limits**: Apps can make requests that take a maximum amount of time per minute.

For example, 120 requests within 60 seconds, with each request taking 0.5 seconds to return. More complex requests take longer and therefore take up a proportionally larger share of the limit. This method is used by the Storefront API.

- **Calculated query costs**: Apps can make requests that cost a maximum number of points per minute.

For example, 1000 points within 60 seconds. More complex requests cost more points and therefore take up a proportionally larger share of the limit. This method is used by the GraphQL API.

Our application communicates with Shopify via their REST API and Shopify limit API calls per second so there is a number of customers that can redeem at the same time.

For example, if your shop has a lot of traffic and many customers try to redeem their points at once, this can lead to a Shopify Rate Limitation making customers unable to redeem their points. To solve this they simply have to wait and try again a few minutes later.

## Using Discount Codes with Points Redemption on Shopify

Beans rewards program applies points redemptions using discount codes. When a customer redeems their points, a discount
code is automatically generated and applied to their cart.

#### Shopify (Classic)

If you are using the classic version of Shopify (not using Shopify Plus), customers are restricted to using only one discount
code at checkout. This means if a customer wishes to redeem their points, they cannot simultaneously apply another discount code.

#### Shopify Plus

Shopify Plus merchants have the option to allow multiple discount codes at checkout. However, enabling this feature
requires contacting Shopify to activate it specifically for your store. Merchants considering this should be aware of the potential
complexities:

- **Mutually Exclusive Discounts**: Even when multiple discounts are technically allowed, certain codes might not be compatible with one another. For
  example, one code might offer a percentage off the total cart value, which could conflict with a fixed amount off provided by the
  points redemption.

- **Custom Redemption Rules**: If you have set specific conditions for using points, such as minimum cart values or certain items being
  exempt from discounts, these rules might conflict with other active discount codes.


## Template Migration

This section is optional and, in most cases, not required.

Template Migration helps the app authenticate customers when they log into your store. By default, the app automatically migrates your templates,
so no action is needed. However, if you prefer to migrate your template manually, follow the steps below.

If this is your first time editing a Shopify template, please ensure you understand how to do so by reviewing Shopifyâ€™s guide:
[How to Edit Shopify Templates](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-code)

To manually migrate your template:

Edit the **layout/theme.liquid** file.
Insert the following code just before the closing tag in the **$</head>$** section.

```yaml
<script>window.beans_cjs_id = '{{ customer.id }}'; window.beans_cjs_email = '{{ customer.email }}';</script>
```

## Shopify OS 2.0

If you are using a Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme, it is essential to enable the Beans app in your Shopify theme.
The new Online Store 2.0 is an improvement released by Shopify to facilitate
full integration for app developers with a merchant's shop.

1. From the Shopify dashboard, go to your Themes page.
2. Locate the Current theme section and click on Customize.
3. Click on Theme Settings, go to the App Embed tab, then locate the Beans Ultimate app extension and switch it on.

## Rewards page

Beans automatically adds a rewards page to your shop.
By default, you can access the page at `https://example.myshopify.com/pages/rewards`, assuming
your website's full URL is `https://example.myshopify.com`.

The Shopify navigation tool let you dynamically set up a navigation menu for your website.
We recommend adding the link to the rewards program in the Main menu in order to make it easy for your customers to access.
Here is how to do: [Editing Shopify store menu](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-online/online-store/menus-and-links/editing-menus)

## Customer accounts

In order to get the app to work as expected, it is required to enable customer accounts for your Shopify Store.
Shopify gives you the option to set customer accounts as disabled, optional or required.
Beans requires customer accounts to be set to optional or required.
Beans support both _Classic customer accounts_ and _New customer accounts_.

Here is how to enable customer accounts with Shopify:
