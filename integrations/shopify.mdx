Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that provides
merchants with the tools they need to sell products online efficiently.
[Integrating Beans with Shopify](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/radix:shopify)
enhances this experience by enabling merchants to boost
customer loyalty through a rewards system. With Beans for Shopify, you can reward customers for their
purchases, encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

To begin, install the [Beans app for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/beans)
through the Shopify App Store. Follow the
[Shopify guideline](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps#install-through-the-shopify-app-store)
on how to install an app through the Shopify App Store.

## Reinstall

If you suspect the Beans plugin isn't properly installed on your Shopify site,
Beans provides a straightforward solution to address this without any negative side effects.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the Shopify integration home page.
2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Template Migration

This section is optional and, in most cases, not required.

Template Migration helps the app authenticate customers when they log into your store. By default, the app automatically migrates your templates,
so no action is needed. However, if you prefer to migrate your template manually, follow the steps below.

If this is your first time editing a Shopify template, please ensure you understand how to do so by reviewing Shopifyâ€™s guide:
[How to Edit Shopify Templates](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-code)

To manually migrate your template:

Edit the **layout/theme.liquid** file.
Insert the following code just before the closing tag in the **$</head>$** section.

```yaml
<script>window.beans_cjs_id = '{{ customer.id }}'; window.beans_cjs_email = '{{ customer.email }}';</script>
```
