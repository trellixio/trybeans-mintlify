## Shopify limitations

### Shopify API Rate

Shopify manages API rate limits using three different methods, each designed for specific use
cases.

The various types of rate limits your apps will encounter are:

**Request-based limits**: Apps can make a maximum number of requests per minute. For example
40 API requests within 60 seconds. Each request counts equally, regardless of how much or how
little data is returned. This method is used by the REST Admin API.

**Time-based limits**: Apps can make requests that take a maximum amount of time per minute.
For example 120 requests within 60 seconds, with each request taking 0.5 seconds to return.
More complex requests take longer and therefore take up a proportionally larger share of the
limit. This method is used by the Storefront API.

**Calculated query costs**: Apps can make requests that cost a maximum number of points per
minute. For example 1000 points within 60 seconds. More complex requests cost more points and
therefore take up a proportionally larger share of the limit. This method is used by the
GraphQL API.

Our application interacts with Shopify via their REST API, which enforces a limit on the
number of API calls per second. This limitation can affect the number of customers who can
redeem points simultaneously.

For instance, if your store experiences high traffic and multiple customers attempt to redeem
points at the same time, the API rate limit might be reached. As a result, some customers may
temporarily be unable to complete their redemption.
To address this, customers simply need to wait a few minutes and try redeeming their points
again.
