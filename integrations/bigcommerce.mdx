BigCommerce is an e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants with the tools
they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with BigCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:bigcommerce)
enhances this functionality by enabling merchants to implement a rewards system that promotes customer loyalty.
With Beans for BigCommerce, you can reward customers for their purchases, encouraging repeat business and
fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the Beans admin dashboard and select **Integrations**.
2. Find and click on **BigCommerce** from the integrations list.
3. Click **Connect** to begin the integration process.
4. You'll need to generate BigCommerce API credentials. To do this:
   - Log in to your BigCommerce admin panel
   - Go to **Settings** > **API** > **Store-level API Accounts**
   - Click **Create API Account**
   - Enter a name for your API account (e.g., "Beans Integration")
   - Under **OAuth Scopes**, ensure all permissions are set to "Full"
   - Click **Save** to generate the API credentials
5. You'll receive three pieces of information that need to be copied to Beans: **Client ID**, **Client secret**, and
   **Access token**.
6. Copy your **BigCommerce API path or Store URL** (it should look like: `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/xxxxxxxx/v3/`)
7. Paste all four credentials into their respective fields in the Beans interface.
8. Click **Connect** to finalize the integration.

2. Select **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
3. From the **Actions** dropdown on the top right, select **Reinstall Beans**.

## Rewards page

Beans automatically adds a rewards page to your shop. By default, you can access the page at
`https://example.mybigcommerce.com/rewards`, assuming your websiteâ€™s full URL is `https://example.mybigcommerce.com`.

To improve the visibility of your rewards program and make it easier for customers to find, we suggest adding a link
to the rewards page in your main menu. Here's an article on how to do it:
