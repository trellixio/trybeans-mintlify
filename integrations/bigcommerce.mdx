## Redemption

### Minimum Points Required for Redemption

To redeem points, customers must have at least a specified minimum amount in their account.
Setting a minimum points threshold ensures that customers accumulate enough points before
they can redeem them.

It's important to set the minimum points level in a way that aligns with both your business
objectives and customer expectations.

**Example**

If the minimum points required for redemption is set to 100, customers will need at least
100 points in their account to redeem rewards.

### Maximum Discount per Redemption

The maximum discount per redemption sets a limit on how much of the total purchase price
can be discounted through points. This ensures that the discounts provided through redemptions
remain within acceptable limits for your business.

**Examples**

If a customer is purchasing a product worth $10 and has 1000 points (equivalent to $10) and
the maximum discount is set to 50%, they will be able to redeem only 500 points, resulting in
a $5 discount.

### Eligible Collections

Enable point redemption for specific product collections in your store.

Beans allows you to designate certain product collections where customers can redeem points
for discounts. By selecting "Eligible Collections," you can promote specific products or
collections within the rewards program, encouraging customer purchases.

Using the Beans admin interface, you can configure which product collections qualify for
point redemption. Once set, customers can redeem points for discounts on items within these
collections.

**Steps to set up Eligible Collections**

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, go to your BigCommerce Integrations home page.
2. Select Preference in the integration menu.
3. Locate the Eligible Collections section.
4. Choose the product collections that will allow point redemption.
5. Click Save to confirm.

Only published products with valid pricing will be available for selection.

### Non-Eligible Collections

Restrict point redemption for specific products in your store.

While Beans allows customers to redeem points for discounts on most purchases, you may want to
exclude certain products from your rewards program. The "Non-Eligible Collections" feature lets
you prevent point redemption for selected items, which can be useful for premium products,
new releases, or specific collections you want to exempt from discounts.

Through the Beans admin interface, you can choose which product collections will be excluded
from point redemption. Once these non-eligible collections are set, customers cannot redeem
points for products in those collections, even if they are members of your rewards program.

**Steps to set up Non-Eligible Collections**

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to your BigCommmerce Integrations home page.
2. Select **Preference** in the integration navigation menu.
3. Find the **Non-Eligible Collections** section.
4. Choose the collection of products that will be excluded from point redemption.
5. When finished, click the **Save** button.

Only products that have been published in your store and have a valid price will be available for selection.

### Advance

**Auto Registration for Rewards Programs**

The Auto Registration feature automates the process of enrolling new customers into a rewards
program. By automatically adding customers when they create an account or complete a purchase,
this integrates customers seamlessly into the program, and maximizes participation by ensuring
no customers are excluded from the outset.
