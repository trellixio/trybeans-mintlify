BigCommerce is an e-commerce platform designed to provide merchants with the tools
they need to sell products online effectively.
[Integrating Beans with BigCommerce](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:bigcommerce)
enhances this functionality by enabling merchants to implement a rewards system that promotes
customer loyalty. With Beans for BigCommerce, you can reward customers for their purchases,
encouraging repeat business and fostering a loyal customer base.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the Beans admin dashboard and select **Integrations**.
2. Find and click on **BigCommerce** from the integrations list.
3. Click **Connect** to begin the integration process.
4. You'll need to generate BigCommerce API credentials. To do this:
   - Log in to your BigCommerce admin panel
   - Go to **Settings** > **API** > **Store-level API Accounts**
   - Click **Create API Account**
   - Enter a name for your API account (e.g., "Beans Integration")
   - Under **OAuth Scopes**, ensure all permissions are set to "Full"
   - Click **Save** to generate the API credentials
5. You'll receive three pieces of information that need to be copied to
   Beans: **Client ID**, **Client secret**, and **Access token**.
6. Copy your **BigCommerce API path or Store URL** (it should look
   like: `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/xxxxxxxx/v3/`)
7. Paste all four credentials into their respective fields in the Beans interface.
8. Click **Connect** to finalize the integration.

## Rewards page

To improve the visibility of your rewards program and make it easier for customers to find,
we suggest adding a link to the rewards page in your main menu. Here's an article on how to do
it: [BigCommerce - Navigation Menu Options](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Web-Pages?language=en_US#navigation).

## Redemption

### Minimum points required for redemption

Sets a minimum points threshold that customers must reach before redeeming rewards. By default,
customers need to accumulate at least 100 points before being eligible for redemption. You can
adjust this threshold higher to ensure meaningful program engagement and prevent inefficient redemptions.
For example, if you set the minimum to 500 points, customers would need to earn at least 500 points before
they can start redeeming rewards.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Redemption** section and enter your desired minimum points threshold in the
   **Minimum Points Required** field.
3. Click **Save** to apply changes.

<Tip>
  Choose a minimum threshold that balances customer satisfaction with your business goals. Too high may discourage
  participation, while too low could reduce program effectiveness.
</Tip>

### Maximum discount per redemption

Sets a limit on how much of the total purchase price can be discounted through points.
This ensures that the discounts provided through redemptions remain within acceptable
limits for your business. For example, if a customer wants to buy a product priced at \$10 and
has 1000 points (equal to \$10), but the maximum discount is set to 50%, they can only use 500
points, giving them a \$5 discount.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Redemption** section and use the **Maximum Discount Per Redemption** slider to set
   your desired maximum discount percentage.
3. Click **Save** to apply changes.

<Tip>
  Setting a reasonable maximum discount percentage helps maintain a balance between rewarding customers and protecting
  your profit margins.
</Tip>

### Eligible collections

Enable point redemption for specific product collections in your store. Customers can then redeem
points only for products in the selected collections. When no collections are selected, all products
are eligible for redemption.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integrations home page, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Eligible Collections** section and click on **Select collections**.
3. Choose the collections you want to make eligible for point redemption.
4. Click **Save** to confirm.

### Collections exclusion - Loyalty

When collections are excluded, customers will not earn points when purchasing products from
those collections. This helps you maintain control over which products contribute to rewards program earnings.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Collections exclusion - Loyalty** section and click on **Select collections**.
3. Choose the collections you want to exclude from points earnings.
4. Click **Save** to confirm.

## Auto registration

Automatically enrolls new customers into your rewards program when they create an account
or make a purchase. This ensures seamless participation and maximum program engagement.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integration dashboard, navigate to **Preferences**.
2. Locate the **Advance** section and switch the **Auto registration** toggle to **On**.
3. Click **Save** to confirm.

## Storefront Display

### Widget

The widget appears as a floating button in the corner of your storefront that displays notifications
to help customers access their rewards program features, including joining the program, redeeming
points, and checking their balance.

**How it works:**

1. From the BigCommerce integration dashboard, navigate to **Storefront display**.
2. Locate and click on **Widget**.
3. In the Widget settings page, toggle "Enable widget" to on.
4. Adjust the widget's position and appearance to match your brand's style.
5. Click **Save** to apply changes.
