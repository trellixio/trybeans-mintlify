## Redemption block

By default, Beans automatically adds a redemption button to your cart and checkout page.
This allows customers to easily redeem their points before completing their purchase.

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/images/toolkits/redeem-button.webp" alt="Redemption button" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Custom theme support

Beans is compatible with most store themes. In some casesâ€”especially with custom themes, the redemption button
may not display correctly. This usually happens when Beans scripts are unable to find the right spot to insert the button.

To fix this, you can manually add the following HTML tag where you want to customize the placement of the
redemption button on your cart page:

`<div class="beans-cart"></div>`
