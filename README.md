### üë©‚Äçüíª Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally.
To install, use the following command

npm install
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```bash
npm start
```

To check for linters issues

```bash
npm run lint
```

### üòé Publishing Changes

Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generates a preview link of the docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
