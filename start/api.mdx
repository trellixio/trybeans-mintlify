Beans provides an API for integrating with custom online stores. The API enables direct
communication between your e-commerce platform and Beans, allowing the implementation of
loyalty and referral features.

## Storefront Integration

Seting up beans.js on Your E-commerce store

Beans.js is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to integrate Beans with any e-commerce
platform. With just a few lines of code, you can add all Beans apps to your store while
enjoying the flexibility to customize the storefront display to ensures customers have easy
access to program information.

### Including beans.js

To set up beans.js, include the script on every page of your store. Load the script directly
from the Beans content delivery network (CDN) at the following URL:

<script src="https://cdn.trybeans.com/lib/ultimate/edge/vanilla/ultimate.beans.js?shop=<<public_id>>"></script>

Replace `<<public_id>>` with your store's unique public identification key. This key is essential
for linking the library to your shop. You can request this key by contacting our customer
support team.

Avoid bundling the script with other assets or hosting it independently to ensure proper
functionality and future updates.

### Initializing beans.js

To enable Beans to identify the currently authenticated user, include the following script on
every page of your store. This ensures the library can recognize the customer's session and
associate interactions with the correct user account.

```
<script>window.beans_cjs_id='1234567890'; window.beans_cjs_email='customer@email.com';</script>
```

**window.beans_cjs_id**: Represents the unique identifier of the currently authenticated customer.
This value should be dynamically assigned based on the logged-in customer's information.
**window.beans_cjs_email**: Represents the email address of the authenticated customer. This value
should be dynamically set to reflect the current session.

```
const config = {
currentPage: '',
onLogin: () => (window.location = '/login'),
onRegister: () => (window.location = '/register'),
liana: {
onAbout: () => (window.location = '/rewards'),
pagePlaceholder: document.getElementById('rewards'),
},
bamboo: {
onAbout: () => (window.location = '/referral'),
pagePlaceholder: document.getElementById('referral'),
},
};
```

**currentPage**: Identifies the current page where beans.js is active. It should match one of the
following values based on the page type:
product | cart | checkout | login | register | reward.
For all other pages, leave this value empty.

**onLogin**: Defines the function for redirecting users to the login page. For instance, if your
login page is located at /login, the function should redirect to this path. Replace /login with the correct location used in your store.

**onRegister**: Defines the function for redirecting users to the registration page. Similarly,
if the registration page is at /register, the function should point to this path, replacing /register
with your store's registration page location.

**liana.onAbout**: Specifies the function for redirecting users to the rewards program page. If
the page is located at /rewards, ensure the function redirects here. Update the path if your
store uses a different location for the rewards program.

**liana.pagePlaceholder**: Refers to the container within the rewards program page where beans.js
will render the program details. Add the following HTML snippet to your rewards program page
to define this container:

```
<div id="rewards"></div>
```

Ensure the value of pagePlaceholder matches the id or selector of this container (rewards in this example).
Beans.js will use this container to display the rewards program dynamically.

**bamboo.onAbout**: Specifies the function responsible for redirecting users to your store's referral
program page. If the referral program page is located at /referral, ensure the function points
to this URL. Update the path to reflect the actual location of the referral program in your
store.

**bamboo.pagePlaceholder**: Defines the container where beans.js will render the referral program
content. Add the following HTML snippet to your referral program page to create the required
container:

```
<div id="referral"></div>
```

Ensure that the value of pagePlaceholder corresponds to the id or selector of this container
(referral in this example). Beans.js will use this container to dynamically render the referral
program interface for your customers.

Just below the initialization data add the following line to initialize beans.js

```
Beans3.Radix.init(config);
```

After successfully integrating Beans with your storefront, the reward and referral program
pages should now be visible and functional on your store.

## Webhooks

Setting up Beans Webhooks

Webhooks provide a mechanism to notify Beans of specific events in your store, such as when
a customer complete order, enabling them to be rewarded for their loyalty. These are simple
URLs where you send a JSON payload with the message details and optional settings.

### Customer Webhook

The Customer Webhook notifies Beans when a new customer registers on your store. To transmit
customer registration data to Beans, use an HTTP POST request like this:

**Customer data**

```
{
"id": 1847,
"first_name": "John",
"last_name": "Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"is_newsletter": True,
"tags": ["loyal", "paying"],
"created_at": "2020-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
"updated_at": "2022-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
}
```

**Create or update a customer**

```
curl https://hooks.radix.trybeans.com/v3/hook/radix/vanilla/customer/hook_created \
 --request POST \
 --user :sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '<<customer_data>>'
```

**Delete a customer**

```
curl https://hooks.radix.trybeans.com/v3/hook/radix/vanilla/customer/hook_deleted \
 --request POST \
 --user :sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '<<customer_data>>'
```

**Order Webhook**

Order Webhook is to let Beans know when a new order is placed in your shop. To post new order
information to Beans just use an HTTP POST request like this one:

**Order data**

An order can contain a customer object.

```
order_data = {
"id": 13207,
"currency": "USD",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"ref": "13207",
"total": "53.00",
"subtotal": "33.00",
"amount_shipping": "20.00",
"amount_giftcard": "0.00",
"amount_tax": "0.00",
"cancelled_at": None,
"processed_at": "2022-02-06T12:49:47-05:00",
"is_fulfilled": False,
"is_refunded": True,
"is_paid": True,
"customer": {

"first_name": "John",
"last_name": "Doe",
